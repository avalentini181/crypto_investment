# Crypto Investment

# About
In this Challenge, I’ll assume the role of an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Competitors are fierce, so I want to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing my proposal on only returns and volatility, I want to include other factors that might impact the crypto market—leading to better performance for my portfolio.

# What I'm Creating
In this Challenge, I’ll combine your financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills that I acquired in this module.

I’ll create a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. I’ll then plot the results so that you can visually show the performance to the board.

The CSV file that’s provided for this Challenge contains the price change data of cryptocurrencies in different periods.
